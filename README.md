## "Empowering the Individual Investor"
 
---

## Overview and Origin

Robinhood in an online brokerage company that was founded with the thought that individual investors could be emowered through clean mobile-focused user interface, low fees, and *"outside-the-box"* investment tools.  The firm was founded by two former Stanford Univertity roommates who - after trying their hand in New York's finance industy - saw a clear need to create an individula investor-targeted online brokerage offering.  

Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt lived and worked in New York after college and started up two companies in a short amount of time. The first wwas an algorithmic trading company called Celeris and the second one was a financial software company called Chronos Research. [^1]  Seeing first-hand that institutions were paying little for trades relative to individual investors and that the online technology and research afforded to this investor class was lacking.

Robinhood was incorporated on April 18, 2013 and their initial funding was $3 million. [^2]  After their May 2020 $280 million funding they have now raised $1.2 billion over  eight separate funds which gets them to an $8.3 billion valuation. [^3]

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

The company has tried to even the playing field for the younger, less-established investor class as it relates to competitive fees as well as research and trading tools.  The driving force for the firm's founding was a belief that the young individal investor has been at a competitive advantage as it relates to the above.  

The company seeks to be the primary place that these often first-time investors go to trade single stocks, ETFs, and Crypto currencies. In addition, in late 2018 and into late 2019, Robinhood sought to get into personal banking in an atempt to expad thier footprint in this demographic's finances.  During this time they were supposedly close to aligning with Ohio-based Sutton Bank where they would issue debit cards to customers and a supposed 3% annual interest rate to be given for bank depostis.  These deposits were to be SPIC-insured but the SPIC denied this. Robinhood had to wait until December 2019 to launch a "cash management" FDIC-backed product that would give customers a 1.8% rate on cash held at Robinhood. [^4]  The age group that the firm has the most traction with is 28 to 41 years old. [^5]


Tenev was on televsion in late_april saying that Robinhood has been getting 50% og the national new brokerage accounts which is more then all the legacy players put together. [

* Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?


* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)



## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

* What are the other major companies in this domain?




THe trajectory of the online brokerage industry over the last twenty years has been one that has had various levels of success in trying to attain its ultimate goal: empowering the individual investor to make to be able to make their own investing decisions in an inexpensive fashion.  The industry has been one that has pushed the technoogial boundaries of the Fintech realm for the better part of twenty years.    

The online brokerage industry is a Fintech indsutry that has undergone massive changes in the last year. Much of these changes occured after the industry saw several of its players try to differniate themselves by offering customers slightly varied platforms that provided things such as naunced research products and low to no fees on products such as ETFs.  In the fall of 2019, large player, Interactive Brokers, sought to gain market share by taking commissions to zero on ETF trades in their IB *"Lite"* service. [^2] 

This *"race to zero"* on fees in the back half of 2019 led to a massive consolidation 

In the last handful of years the industry has become very fragamented as players tried to differentiate themselves by offering different things to customers.

The second half of 2019 saw the industry try to come up with ways to ramp trading activity as online customers (read retail) keenly took their money out of the market as the market grund slowly to all-time highs.
